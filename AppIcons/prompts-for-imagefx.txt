Create a simple, friendly design for "IlluMefy", a platform for discovering gaming influencers:

1. Simple Tag Design:
   - A clean, minimalist tag/label shape as the main element and it's background is transparent
   - The tag has a small hole at one end (like a real price tag)
   - A subtle glow or light effect emanating from the tag

2. Color approach:
   - A fresh aqua blue to teal gradient as the primary color scheme
   - The gradient should flow smoothly from lighter aqua to slightly deeper teal
   - Optional: very subtle accents of white or silver for highlights

3. Visual simplicity:
   - Clean, modern design with smooth edges
   - No complex patterns - focus on the iconic tag shape
   - Should be instantly recognizable even at small sizes

4. Style reference:
   - Clean and modern like popular apps
   - Professional but friendly look
   - The aqua/teal color should give a fresh, technological feel while remaining approachable

The icon should be simple enough to be immediately understood and remembered. It should convey the concept of tagging and discovery while maintaining a light, modern aesthetic with the refreshing aqua blue color palette. abstract minimal don't create extra space around of the main image
